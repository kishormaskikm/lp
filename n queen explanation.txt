Explanation of the code
is_attack(int i,int j) →  This is a function to check if the cell (i,j) is under attack by any other queen or not. We are just checking if there is any other queen in the row ‘i’ or column ‘j’. Then we are checking if there is any queen on the diagonal cells of the cell (i,j) or not. Any cell (k,l) will be diagonal to the cell (i,j) if k+l is equal to i+j or k-l is equal to i-j.

N_queen → This is the function where we are really implementing the backtracking algorithm.

if(n==0) → If there is no queen left, it means all queens are placed and we have got a solution.

if((!is_attack(i,j)) && (board[i][j]!=1)) → We are just checking if the cell is available to place a queen or not. is_attack function will check if the cell is under attack by any other queen and board[i][j]!=1 is making sure that the cell is vacant. If these conditions are met then we can put a queen in the cell – board[i][j] = 1.

if(N_queen(n-1)==1) → Now, we are calling the function again to place the remaining queens and this is where we are doing backtracking. If this function (for placing the remaining queen) is not true, then we are just changing our current move – board[i][j] = 0 and the loop will place the queen on some another position this time.
